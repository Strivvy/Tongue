1. Set the new target location to the player's location.
2. Make the hook move in a straight line to the player (this means make the grapple hook travel down the straight vector that belongs to the player's location relative to the grapple hook's location).
3. Make a new timeline for this.
4. Set an event dispatcher in BP_GrappleComponent before it's destroyed.
5. Set an event listener in BP_GrappleHook.
6. (Wait for step 6).
